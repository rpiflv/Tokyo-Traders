## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

This application lets you swap things you do not need anymore with other users, allowing you to save money and at the same time lessen the amount of waste.
<br/>
Here's why:

* Getting rid of things you do not need can take time, efforts and sometimes also money, so better to have something back!
* The more you waste and produce, the higher is your footprint. Remember, we only have one World!
* Save the World and saving money, still need more? :bird: :bird: :rock:


## Built With

The backend of this application has been built using Django Rest Framework and PostgrsQL as database. Frontend is built with Javascript using ReactJS library, styled with Material UI.
