# TOKYO TRADERS 交換

## Exchange what you do not need anymore with something you need!

This application lets you swap things you do not need anymore with other users, allowing you to save money and at the same time lessen the amount of waste.

### Why the name Tokyo Traders?
This application has been created for the final team project of a code bootcamp located in Tokyo. In this huge and dense city we could see every day the amount of trash that is generated, along with the amount of new stuff bought.
