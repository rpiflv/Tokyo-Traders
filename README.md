# TOKYO TRADERS 交換

## Exchange what you do not need anymore with something you need!

This application lets you swap things you do not need anymore with other users, allowing you to save money and at the same time lessen the amount of waste.

### Why the name Tokyo Traders?
This team project has been created as a final assignment of a code bootcamp located in Tokyo. We could see every day the amount of trash that is generated in this huge and dense city, but what really surprised us was the quantity of still usable things just thrown away. So why do not help people living in Tokyo to exchange their things instead of just getting rid of them?
